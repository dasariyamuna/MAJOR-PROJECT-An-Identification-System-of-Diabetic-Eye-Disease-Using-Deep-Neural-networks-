# 👁️ Deep Diabetic Eye Disease Identification System Using Deep Neural Networks

## 📌 Overview
Diabetic Eye Disease, especially **Diabetic Retinopathy**, is a serious complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness if not detected early.  
This project presents a **Deep Learning–based system** that automatically detects and classifies diabetic eye disease from retinal fundus images using **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Manual diagnosis of diabetic eye disease requires expert ophthalmologists and is time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error. In many regions, early screening facilities are limited.  
There is a need for an **automated, accurate, and scalable system** to detect diabetic eye disease at an early stage.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The proposed system uses **Deep Neural Networks (CNN-based architecture)** to analyze retinal images and identify the presence and severity of diabetic eye disease.  
The model learns complex patterns from medical images and provides reliable predictions to assist healthcare professionals.
